# Unity_Xenophobia_Cyclone
In this UNITY repository are listed all files responsible for Cyclone's functionality (animation, physics, tools, etc.). 

The main idea behind this project is learning C# and Unity game engine. I have started game development with Unity and this poject is my sandbox. Here I have made all possible mistakes to remember them. In order to cover more mechanics I have decided to implement 3 different movement methods for 3 different characters:
  1) Cyclone, main character, is using root motion for almost all of his actions. Thus hes movement is controlled by animation manager script.
  2) Drone, one of Cyclone's tools, relies in it's movement on rigidbody component and thus is controlled by Drone's physics manager script.
  3) Spider, also one of Cyclone's tools, uses raycasting to move around. Complex system of raycasting via spider controller script allows him to climb walls at 90 degrees angle.

So as you can see, I've focused on mastering wide veriety of machanics to be able to use them all in future. Sometimes code you see in this Unity version of my Xenophobia project may look like chaos, but be assured it's not because I wanted to make something fast but because I've been trying out something new to me. 

Ofcourse the game is incomplete, just small part of gameplay mechanics is implemented. That's because I've desided to temporarely leave Unity in favor of Unreal. Thanks to Unity I've reached a certain level of skill in programming and manipulating game engine to start learning Unreal with C++. But I'd be happy to return to Unity if someone finds my C# skills interesting. Please feel free to send me an email to get access to my private C++ repository.
